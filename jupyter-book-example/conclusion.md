# Conclusion
## Observations
Let's review the winners again for each of the categories we looked at.

| **Category**          | **Road** | **Touring**  | **Mountain** |
|-----------------------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Potential Profits     | Road-150 | Touring-1000 | Mountain-100 |
| Highest Sales Numbers | Road-350 | Touring-1000 | Mountain-200 |
| Average Profit Earned | Road-350 | Touring-1000 | Mountain-500 |
| Bike-to-Size Ratio    | Road-150 | Touring-1000 | Mountain-100 |

### Road Bikes
The Road-150 has the best size-to-weight ratio. It also scored the highest for road bikes in potential profits. It did not have any past sales, which means we could use the good size-to-weight ratio and the bike's inclusion in the tour program as a marketing tactic to increase sales. The Road-150 is rated for intermediate-to-professional riders, so this bike would be perfect for some of the harder-to-navigate trips. However, if we want to select a bike based only on previous sales/profits, then the Road-350 would be the best choice.
> **Note**: Product descriptions and associated rider experience can be obtained from the `ProductModel` table.

### Touring Bikes
The Touring-1000 scored the best in every category for touring bikes, which makes it a pretty clear choice for selection. The description for this bike is: *Travel in style and comfort. Designed for maximum comfort and safety. Wide gear range takes on all hills. High-tech aluminum alloy construction provides durability without added weight.* This bike will be good for all rider levels, and it will be a great choice to add to the program.

### Mountain Bikes
The Mountain-100 has the best size-to-weight ratio for its category. It also has the potential to earn the highest profits for its type. Remember that while the Mountain-200 had the highest number of units sold for its type, it sold at a loss in profit. The Mountain-100 is described as: *Our top-of-the-line competition mountain bike. Performance-enhancing options include the innovative HL frame, super-smooth front suspension, and traction for all terrain.* It is rated for advanced-to-professional riders. The Mountain-500, however, is described as: *Suitable for any type of riding, on or off-road. Fits any budget. Smooth-shifting with a comfortable ride.* This earned the highest average profits and is suitable for novice-to-intermediate riders. Therefore, adding both of these bikes to the fleet may be worthwhile.
