**Welcome to the Bike Sales Data Sample Jupyter Book!**

## Scenario

You work for **AdventureWorks** â€” a company that sells a variety of outdoor equipment and accessories. The company wants to create a new bike tour program. Through this program, customers can rent bikes and explore a number of international trails and hikes led by guides from AdventureWorks. Your job is to select the bikes for the new program from the company's current inventory. You'll consider previous sales, potential profits, and the type of bike that would work for these adventures.

Use this notebook to review the data and make observations about the company's bike inventory.

## Connecting to the Data
This Jupyter Book explores data from the AdventureWorks sample database (specifically, the `AdventureWorksLT2019` version). If you want to test the queries within the notebook files, you will need to set up a local or cloud-based connection to the database. See [SQL Docs: AdventureWorks Sample Databases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssmsEnsure) for more information on connecting to this database.
